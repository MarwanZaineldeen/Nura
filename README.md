# Mental Health Chatbot - Project V1
 
A modular AI-powered mental health chatbot pipeline built with Python. The system detects language, classifies emotions and intents, retrieves relevant context, and generates empathetic responses.

## Important Notes Before You Start
 
**Models are NOT included** in this repository due to large file sizes. You must run each module first to train and generate the models locally before running the chatbot.
 
**This code lives on the `Project_V1` branch** — after cloning, make sure to switch to it or you will see Marwan's code instead.
 
---
 
## Getting Started
 
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarwanZaineldeen/Mental-Health-Chatbot.git
cd Mental-Health-Chatbot
```
 
### 2. Switch to the correct branch
```bash
git checkout Project_V1
```
Without this step you will be on the main branch and will NOT see this code.
 
### 3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # On Windows
```
 
### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
Or install manually:
```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy datasets huggingface-hub sentence-transformers faiss-cpu langchain openai python-dotenv flask gradio
```
 
### 5. Set up environment variables
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Open .env and fill in your configuration
```

## Step-by-Step: Run Modules to Generate Models
 
Since models are not pushed to GitHub, you must run each module in order to train and save them locally before using the chatbot.
 
### Step 1 - Language Detection Model
```bash
python Module1.py
```
Trains and saves the language detection model.
 
### Step 2 - Emotion Classification Model
```bash
python Module2.py
```
Trains and saves the emotion classification model.
 
### Step 3 - Intent Classification Model
```bash
python Module3.py
```
Trains and saves the intent classification model.
 
### Step 4 - RAG Retrieval & Response Model
```bash
python Module4.py
```
Builds the retrieval index and saves the response generation model.

## Run the Chatbot
 
Once all 4 modules have been run and models are saved, start the chatbot:
 
```bash
python inference.py
```
 
Or run the full integrated pipeline:
 
```bash
python integration.py
```

## Modules Overview
 
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| Module1.py | Detects the language of the user input (Arabic / English) |
| Module2.py | Classifies the emotion in the message (sadness, anxiety, anger, etc.) |
| Module3.py | Identifies the user intent (seeking support, venting, asking for advice, etc.) |
| Module4.py | Retrieves relevant context using RAG and prepares the response |
| integration.py | Connects all 4 modules into one end-to-end pipeline |
| inference.py | Main entry point — run this to chat with the bot |

## API Testing

The chatbot exposes a REST API endpoint that can be tested using Postman or any HTTP client.

### Endpoint
